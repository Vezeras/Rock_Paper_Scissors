<!--The following comments are meant to be my psuedocode,
followed by my actual JS code for the console -->

<!--
Define function for computer guess
Return random guess from array of strings for computer
Prompt user guess for Rock, Paper, or Scissors
Define string values so Scissors beats Paper, Paper beats Rock, and Rock beats scissors
Compare computer to user guess
Implement comparator to define winner
